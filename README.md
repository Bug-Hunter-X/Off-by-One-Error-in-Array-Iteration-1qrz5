This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java array iteration. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version. The error arises from the loop condition `i <= arr.length`, which should be `i < arr.length` to avoid accessing an element beyond the array bounds. This simple example illustrates a subtle bug that can be difficult to detect in larger programs.
